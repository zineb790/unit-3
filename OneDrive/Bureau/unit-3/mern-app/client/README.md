# Introduction

This is the client folder of my mern-app .
you get started with npm start to be able to see the main UI of app.
my app is giving you the ability to create a simple everyday activity with the ability to include a picture and a description of the event.
the mern-app is providing the features of the signup and login as well as the log out options to keep data secure and activities safe .
in the home page you can see a list of all activities performed during the use of the project.
in the createActivity page you can create an activity and post request to the home page to be able to see it.
every activity is including a save button and stored in the saved activities page

## Technologies Used

in the server side i am using express, jsonwebtoken ,mongoose , bycrypt and cors to respond to my client requests.
you can run and connect to mongoose by npm start .
in the client side react, axios and react-router-dom are used to better serve the UI.

### Unsolved Problems
the app is still under development for the delete and update of the data.

#### Future Enhancements

working on the ability to add more options to the navbar and animation with css
